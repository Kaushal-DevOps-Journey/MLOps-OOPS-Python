1. Class and object (example)
2. Class has data/attributes and func/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, and methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called OOP? --Everything in python is an object (data structure, data type etc.)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > Code Usability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab
